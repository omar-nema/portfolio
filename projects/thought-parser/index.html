            'Thought Parser' is intended to reveal stories that lie hidden and interwoven between individual journal entries. <strong>The project holds two years of journal content, consumed and visualized by an algorithm.</strong>

        <p>
          Thought Parser was built from the ground-up in code. The underlying dataset - my journal - was fed as a simple text file. Using this text file, I first experimented with methods to ingest thousands of words in a performant manner. I created a backend server (in node.js) to read and parse the text file. Within the node.js server, I tested out a number of libraries for parsing text and discerning structured information. I compared each library's performance on a small, but meaningful segment of text (a portion of my journal that represented a cohesive narrative). Compromise.js fared well on my quick tests, pulling out a number of coherent phrases. I constrained my project to use this library, and focused on refining the visual.

        <p class="block-subheader">Visual Experimentation</p>
        <p>
          Visually, I experimented with two main approaches. In the first iteration, I emulated the process of writing with an animation. Words were drawn on the page gradually. My initial aim was to take the viewer through the process of writing, while having the algorithm provide commentary. I found myself drawn to the end result, however, rather than the animation. Seeing a full year of writing laid out and parsed was powerful. I felt vulnerable and exposed. Exploring the resulting visual, I was able to find a number of patterns in my own thinking. I thus re-worked the visual to its current form - an exploratory tool for navigating patterns in thought, and uncovering honest, vulnerable stories.
