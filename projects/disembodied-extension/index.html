          I'm often taken aback when watching a stranger use social media on their phone. From a distance, it's easy to see the dull trance that someone can fall into when using a social media platform. Platforms like Instagram are designed for breadth, not depth. We are encouraged to consume as much content as possible.
          <br><br>
          Although I fall into the same mindless trance when using social media, I am unable to really *see* what my browsing activity looks like. I see, but I cannot see myself see. And so I continue to consume.
          <br><br>
          This project is an attempt to make the viewer aware of their own browsing patterns, and expose the power the attention economy can hold. The process of developing this project - viewing Instagram and my personal browsing activity over and over - has allowed me to internalize my own browsing habits (suffice to say, I'm taking a break from social media).

        Upon installing Disembodied Browsing, Instagram.com will look a little different. The extension will replace the Instagram header with a custom header that allows the viewer to 'end' a browsing session. Upon doing so, browsing behavior is played back to the viewer (meaning, your computer will start scrolling on its own, and mimic your activity). Content is greyed out when played back - prompting the viewer to question whether or not they processed the content, and can recall it readily. 
        <br><br>
        The extension is currently under review to be published in the Google Play Store. Click the video below to watch a demo.
